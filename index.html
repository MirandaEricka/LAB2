			<h2>What is <u>Geometric Construction</u>?</h2> 
			<p class="meaning">Geometric construction, also known as <u><font color="gray">Euclidean construction</u><font color="black">, is referred to as <i>&quot; pure &quot;</i> form of construction in geometry since it <b>does not involve numbers</b>. It also means making of <u><font color="gray">geometric figures</u><font color="black"> <b>accurately</b> just by using the following tools:
				<ul>
					<li>ruler or any straight edge
					<li>compass
					<li>pencil
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2> Learn the following</h2>
				<p class="meaning">
					<ul>
						<li>angle bisector
						<li>copy of an angle
						<li>copy of a triangle
					</ul>
				</p>
		</div>

			<h3>Angle Bisector</h3>
				<p class="examples"> 
				<ol> 
					<li>Start with angle PQR that we will bisect.
					<li>Place the compasses’ point on the angle’s vertex Q.
					<li>Adjust the compasses to a medium wide setting. The exact width is not important.
					<li>Without changing the compasses’ width, draw an arc across each leg of the angle.
					<li>The compasses’ width can be changed here if desired. Place the compasses on the point where one arc crosses a leg and draw an arc in the interior of the angle.
					<li>Without changing the compasses’ setting repeat for the other leg so that the two arcs cross.
					<li>Using a straightedge or a ruler, draw a line from the vertex to the point where the arcs cross.
				</ol>
				</p>
			<h3>Copy of an Angle</h3>
				<p class="examples">
				<ol>
					<li>Start with an angle.
					<li>With one point of the compass at the vertex of the given angle, draw an arc that intersects both of its rays.
					<li>With one point of the compass at the point where the vertes=x of the new angle is supposed to be, draw an arc that intersects the ray of the new angle and extends far from the ray in one direction. The compass needs to be open the same amount as it was in the previous step.
					<li>Use the compass to measure the distance between the two points of intersection of the given angle and its arc. This length needs to be usedin the next step.
					<li>with one point on the intersectionof the ray of the new angle and its arc, draw an arc so that it intersects the other arc that was drawn for the new angle. 
					<li>Draw the ray from the vertex of the angle to the intersection of the two arcs.
				</ol>
				</p>
			<h3>Copy of a Triangle</h3>
				<p class="examples">
				<ol>
					<li>Start with triangle ABC.
					<li>Mark a point P that will be one vertex of the new triangle.
					<li>Set the compasses' width to the length of one side of the original triangle ABC. In this example, use AC.
					<li>With the compasses' point on P, make an arc near where the next vertex of the triangle will be.
					<li>Mark a point R on the arc. This will become the next vertex of the new triangle. PR is equal in length to AC.
					<li>Use the compasses to measure the length of the side AB in the original triangle.
					<li>Place the compasses' point on P and make an arc in the vicinity of where the third vertex will be. All points along this arc are the distance AB from P, but we do not know exactly where on this arc the vertex is.
					<li>Use the compasses to measure the length of the side BC in the original triangle.
					<li>From point R, draw an arc crossing the first, where these intersect is the vertex Q of the triangle.
					<li>Finally, draw the three sides of the new triangle PQ, PR, QR.
				</ol>
